 * Which directory the dev server that served a page runs in.

 * committed `.reticle.json`, so the projectId cannot tell them apart, but the process serving the
 * page runs inside exactly one of them. Lives with the session rather than the artifact resolver
 * because both observations are about this machine's processes -- daemon state files and `lsof` --
 * which `memory/project` has no business knowing. The resolver takes the answer as an injected
 * function; the composition roots pass this one.
